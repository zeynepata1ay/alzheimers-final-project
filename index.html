  <h1>Global Insights Into Alzheimer’s Risk Factors</h1>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to severe cognitive decline and loss of independence. Symptoms include severe memory loss, poor planning, and loss of physical control. It is unfortunately quite common. Affecting 6.9 million Americans, its prevalence is rising, potentially due to controllable environmental factors (NIH Alzheimers and Environmental Factors). Further, recent scientific discoveries have shown our previous theory of Alzheimer's, the amyloid cascade hypothesis, is incorrect. And in the literature, the specific cause of Alzheimer's is still poorly understood. Highly efficacious Alzheimer's medications remain to be seen. However, it may be possible to reduce the odds of developing the disease via lifestyle changes. For our project, we examined biological features from our dataset such as age, Body Mass Index (BMI), the Genetic Risk Factor (APOE-ε4 allele). We also looked at environmental factors including physical activity, smoker status, and sleep quality to evaluate if the disease was predominantly affected by nature or nurture. After combining all these factors, we sought to provide actionable recommendations for preventing Alzheimer’s disease.

    <h2>DATA</h2>
    <p> The dataset chosen for this project is the “Alzheimer’s Prediction Dataset (Global)” sourced from Kaggle. This dataset is comprehensive, containing 74,283 records collected from 20 countries. It offers valuable insights into Alzheimer’s disease risk factors, including demographic, lifestyle, medical, and genetic variables. The dataset reflects real-world disparities across regions by incorporating a biased distribution, so conclusions about risk factors may be less applicable to countries less represented. It includes more than 2,000 observations and over 10 features, with a mix of categorical and continuous attributes. These characteristics enabled diverse analyses and visualizations, allowing our group to explore factors and present findings effectively. <p>

      <p><strong>Interactive Feature Importance:</strong> This interactive graph shows grouped values reclassified to answer common Alzheimer's questions. This is RandomForestRegressor data which gives a good estimate on the importance of factors for predicting Alzheimer's. This data is also isolated to Americans to provide best fit.

        **Nature Vs Nurture**
        This shows that nature factors had a 22.82% influence on predicting a positive Alzheimer’s diagnosis. Nurture factors had a 77.18% influence (Factors like physical activity level, sleep quality, and social engagement level). This proves that genetic factors are NOT significantly more predictive of Alzhiemers, a common misconception.
        
        **Importance of Taking Care of Your Body**
        This shows that factors within your control and a part of taking good care of your body amount to 43.48%. Most of this is attributed to BMI with the other 6 features each about 4%. This indicates that healthy body and weight habits may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's substantially. We know many people never progress the disease, with roughly half being non-genetic and preventable (https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-is-alzheimers-type-3-diabetes/). This graph aligns well with that.
        
        **Impact of Life Choices**
        The impact of your life choices is significant, Yes features make up a majority of the predictive power. BMI and education are clearly hugely impactful (~33%). Debatable factors are things that could be out of the individual's control like sleep quality and income. Though this is a RandomForest algorithm, life choice and circumstance clearly form a big role in the disease development.
        
        Along with biological factors which are out of patients’ control, we also looked into the impacts of lifestyle habits or the question of “nature vs. nurture”. Nature factors had a 22.82% influence on predicting a positive Alzheimer’s diagnosis (Factors like patient’s age, their genetic risk factor, or family history of Alzheimer’s).  Nurture factors had a 77.18% influence (Factors like physical activity level, sleep quality, and social engagement level). 
        
        Regarding life choices, a patient’s physical activity level, smoking status, alcohol consumption level, dietary habits, social engagement level, BMI, and education level had the greatest role in predicting a positive Alzheimer’s diagnosis with a 52.20% influence rate.

      <p><strong>Random Forest Regressor Explanation:</strong> This feature importance graph for predicting Alzheimer's disease. Clear predictors include BMI, Education Level and Age. BMI has the highest factor significantly and explains the data more so than socialization, employment status, depression level, sleep quality, alcohol consumption etc. BMI or body mass index is a measure of weight to height ratio. Commonly it is used to classify if people are overweight. (It's not an ideal measure because it does not differentiate muscle and fat tissue.) Those that consistently eat in a surplus can damage their metabolic and insulin response. Here, a  study supports insulin resistance with down steam effects resulting in neurodegeneration. In simplifying insulin resistance leads to neurotoxic plaques (beta-amyloid) and reduced glucose uptake by neurons. Reduced glucose uptake is insulin resistance which leads to reduced Mitochondrial ATP output. New neural connections are prevented by the inability to maintain microtubules. Insulin resistance causes increased activity from kinases  GSK-3β which Hyperphosphorylate tau protein, this is a key building block of microtubules. Microtubules, as a basis,  form neurites (new brain connections)  and axons (extensions/connections of brain). We stress that maintaining a healthy body weight is important. And sugar is extensively linked to insulin spikes.  To some extent a modern diet is taxing on the brain. We’ve already talked about age. Beyond the 78 year old cutoff, risk of Alzheimers continues to increase up to 100s and beyond. Education level is supported by the scientific literature on the “Cognitive Reserve Theory”. Cognitive Reserve theory states that using your brain and learning makes your brain more resistant to the degrading effects of dementia. Dementia for more educated people may appear out of nowhere and with increased severity. Being a lifelong learner may prolong healthy executive functioning.

      <p><strong>Correlation Values Explanation:</strong> This barchart shows the linear correlation values for our target variable “Alzheimer's Diagnosis”.  Age would typically have the biggest correlation. However we sub selected 78 years and older (see Age Distribution graph). We note “Family History of Alzheimer’s” and the genetic risk factor “APOE-e4 allele” are clear predictors while the rest have no clear linear relationship to Alzheimer's diagnosis including age, BMI, and Education Level. Despite these factors being known in the scientific literature to be linked.

This graph shows the linear correlation values calculated for our target variable “Alzheimer's Diagnosis”. We note “Family History of Alzheimer’s” and the genetic risk factor “APOE-e4 allele” are clear predictors while the rest have no clear linear relationship to Alzheimer's diagnosis. Factors  age, BMI, and Education Level were near 0, despite being known in the scientific literature to be linked factors.

      <p><strong>Density Plot Design:</strong> This is a density plot showing the age distribution for Alzheimer's diagnosis statuses. For those without an Alzheimer's diagnosis, the data is positively skewed, with ages 50-65 having the highest rates of negative diagnoses. For those with an Alzheimer's diagnosis, the data is negatively skewed, with ages 80-95 having the highest rates of positive diagnoses. Negative diagnoses tend to sharply drop between the ages of 63-65, 74-78, and 93-97. Positive diagnoses rapidly increase between the ages of 45-50, 64-67, and 74-80. At age 78, the rate of those affected by Alzheimer's becomes greater than the rate of those who are not affected. There are no noticeable potential outliers in this graph.

    <div id="desc-family_history_chart.html">
      <p><strong>Family History Design:</strong> This plot shows the percentage of those aged 78 and older who have a family history of Alzheimer's Disease, separated by Alzheimer's diagnosis. 20% of the population that is not affected by Alzheimer's (1878 people) have a family history of the disease. 35% of the population that is affected by Alzheimer's (6461 people) have a family history of the disease. Out of those who have a positive Alzheimer's diagnosis, there is a noticeably higher proportion of people who have a family history of the disease compared to those who have a negative Alzheimer's diagnosis.

        The interactive feature of this plot allows users to adjust the lengths of each of the bars. This feature ensured that the correct percentages of those who had a family history of the disease were noted. The hover-over menu, or tooltip, provides the exact counts of those who do and do not have a family history of Alzheimer's Disease, which is not clearly seen in the graph.

    <div id="desc-genetic_risk_chart.html">
      <p><strong>Genetic Risk Design:</strong> This plot shows the percentage of those aged 78 and older who have the APOE-ε4 allele, which gives them a higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's Disease, separated by Alzheimer's diagnosis. Around 9% of the population that is not affected by Alzheimer's (865 people) have the allele. Around 26% of the population that is affected by Alzheimer's (4765 people) have the allele. Out of those who have a positive Alzheimer's diagnosis, there is a noticeably higher proportion of people who have the APOE-ε4 allele compared to those who have a negative Alzheimer's diagnosis. This means that having this genetic risk factor can predispose someone to an Alzheimer's diagnosis.

        The interactive feature of this plot allows users to adjust the lengths of each of the bars. This feature helps determine the exact percentages of the populations with the genetic risk factor; otherwise, it would be assumed that the percentages were 10% and 25% instead of 9% and 26%. The hover-over menu, or tooltip, provides the exact counts of those who do and do not have the APOE-ε4 allele, which is not clearly seen in the graph.

    <h2>SUMMARY & FINDINGS</h2>
    <p>In this project, we sought to answer which factors played the greatest role in predicting Alzheimer’s Disease diagnoses. As this disease affects millions of people, we believe it's important to provide actionable advice for its prevention. Our exploration of correlation factors and genetic risk populations showed us that having a family history of Alzheimer’s and APOE-ε4 allele were two clear linear factors in Alzheimer’s prediction. Along with biological factors which are out of patients’ control, we also looked into the impacts of lifestyle habits or the question of “Nature vs. Nurture”. Nature factors had a 22.82% influence on predicting a positive Alzheimer’s diagnosis. Factors like age, genetic risk, or family history. Nurture factors had a 77.18% influence. This data lends credence that personal action and circumstance has a significant impact on Alzheimers. 

      Our findings have shown that age and genetics remain the clearest factors for Alzheimer’s diagnosis. However the impact of lifestyle choices should not be overlooked. In terms of body health: BMI, physical activity, dietary habits and others predict Alzheimer’s diagnosis. Therefore it is efficacious to monitor BMI and make healthy food choices. Activities like going outside with friends or sports are two effective ways to promote physical activity and socialization. Further, higher education may also lower your risk. In conclusions we find that risk factors mitigation can enable individuals to avoid or delay Alzheimer’s disease despite some factors being beyond patient control.
